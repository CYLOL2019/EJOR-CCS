# SEC-CCS
This repository contains demos for the seven immplemented in "Utilizing Dependence among Variables in Evolutionary Algorithms for Mixed-Integer Programming: A Case Study on Multi-Objective Constrained Portfolio Optimization", a manuscript for Swarm and Evolutionary Compuation.
# Execution
Please find the demo.m file for each algorithm, it is setting for problem 'port5' with the first constraint set, Cardinality ${K=10}$, floor $\epsilon_i=0.01$, ceiling $\delta_i=1.0$, pre-assignment ${z_{30}=1}$ and round lot $\tau=0.008.$
